In this code, we first initialize an empty dictionary char_count to store the count of each character. Then we iterate over each character in the input string, skipping over any spaces. For each character, we check if it is already in the dictionary, and either increment its count or add it with a count of 1. Finally, we print out the resulting dictionary of characterÂ counts.
